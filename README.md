Open-source Python toolkit for AML detection and financial crime analytics — transaction graph analysis, anomaly scoring, SAR pattern matching, and SQL helpers for BSA/FinCEN compliance.

Built by a financial crimes analytics practitioner for compliance teams and data professionals working in anti-money laundering programs at financial institutions.

---

## Why this exists

Smaller financial institutions often lack the analytics infrastructure to detect sophisticated money laundering patterns. This toolkit provides open, reusable building blocks — grounded in FATF typologies and FinCEN advisories — that any compliance or data team can use to strengthen their AML detection program.

---

## AML typologies covered

| Typology | Module | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Structuring (smurfing) | `aml/patterns.py` | FinCEN Advisory FIN-2014-A005 |
| Layering | `aml/graph.py` | FATF Typologies Report 2006 |
| Rapid fund movement | `aml/velocity.py` | FATF Guidance on AML/CFT 2012 |
| Network-based laundering | `aml/graph.py` | FinCEN Advisory FIN-2022-A001 |
| Anomalous transaction behavior | `aml/anomaly.py` | FATF Risk-Based Approach 2014 |

---

## Modules

| Module | Description |
|---|---|
| `aml/synthetic.py` | Synthetic AML transaction generator with labeled scenarios |
| `aml/graph.py` | Transaction network analysis — structuring rings, layering chains, centrality scoring |
| `aml/velocity.py` | Rolling-window velocity checks for burst activity detection |
| `aml/patterns.py` | Rules engine implementing FATF and FinCEN typologies |
| `aml/anomaly.py` | Unsupervised anomaly scoring using Isolation Forest and LOF |
| `aml/sql/` | Oracle and PostgreSQL query templates for AML detection |

---

## Quick start

```python
from aml.synthetic import generate_transactions
from aml.graph import build_network, detect_structuring, detect_layering

# Generate synthetic transaction data
txns = generate_transactions(n=1000)

# Build a transaction network
G = build_network(txns)

# Detect structuring rings
rings = detect_structuring(G, threshold=9000)

# Detect layering chains
chains = detect_layering(G, min_hops=3)

print(f"Structuring alerts: {len(rings)}")
print(f"Layering alerts:    {len(chains)}")
```

---
